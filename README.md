Coral Reef Facts

Coral reefs are rocky mounds and/or ridges formed in the sea by living things through the accumulation and deposition of limestone (calcium carbonate).

These undersea palaces are home to more species of fishes, corals, and many other type of marine life than any other ocean habitat.

Coral reefs also provide many valuable services to humans. Food, shoreline protection, and medicines are just a few of these benefits. These are also the best places to visit if you want to experience marine life - up close and personal.
